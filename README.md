Write a program that demonstrates that you understand creating and consuming
RESTful APIs. If you can not think of a project to do:
Create a Web application in Flask that has a RESTful API, the application
should link to one or more database tables.
You should also create the web pages that can consume the API. I.e. performs
CRUD operations on the data.
